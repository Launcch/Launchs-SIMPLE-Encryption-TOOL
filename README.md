Simple Text/File Encrypter/Decrypter

A simple and secure desktop app for encrypting and decrypting text/files using Fernet symmetric encryption with a key derived via PBKDF2HMAC/Argon2ID. Perfect for personal use or sharing encrypted messages securely.

- Encrypt and decrypt any text and most files(including videos/photos)

- Optional password protection

- Simple, offline tool — no data is ever sent anywhere

- Built with Python and Tkinter

**Always use a password** for anything important. The app supports no-password encryption, but it uses a fixed key shared across all users — it's fast and simple, but not private.

This app DOES NOT store your password, encrypted text, or any data. It’s entirely offline.

**YOU are responsible** for saving your encrypted messages and passwords securely.
